If the bucket contains objects, then the function first deletes the objects and then the bucket. Otherwise, the function directly deletes the bucket. Note that you need to delete all object versions. The deletion of versions is necessary only if you have enabled Bucket Versioning. Note that the function also removes delete markers. These are placeholders that are created after you delete objects in a versioning-enabled bucket. You can learn more about them [here](https://www.learnaws.org/2022/10/04/aws-s3-delete-marker/#what-is-an-aws-s3-delete-marker).\n",
