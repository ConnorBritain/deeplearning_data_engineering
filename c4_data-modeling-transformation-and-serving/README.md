# Data Modeling and Transformation ðŸ§©ðŸ”„

Welcome to the repository for **Course 4: Data Modeling and Transformation** in the DeepLearning.AI Data Engineering Professional Certificate. This course focuses on data modeling techniques and transformations for analytics and machine learning.

## ðŸ“– Overview

We explore different data modeling methodologies, apply transformations to prepare data for analytics and machine learning, and work with both batch and streaming data processing frameworks.

## ðŸ—“ Course Structure

### **Week 1: Data Modeling & Simple Transformations for Analytics**

- **Learning Objectives:**
  1. Define data modeling and its importance in reflecting business logic.
  2. Apply normalization stages to a denormalized table.
  3. Explain the use of fact and dimension tables in a star schema.
  4. Differentiate between data warehouse modeling approaches (Inmon, Kimball, Data Vault).
  5. Transform data in third normal form to a star schema.
  6. Describe the use of hub, link, and satellite tables in a data vault model.
  7. Discuss the pros and cons of using a single large table.

### **Week 2: Data Modeling & Simple Transformations for Machine Learning**

- **Learning Objectives:**
  1. Differentiate between supervised vs. unsupervised learning, and classification vs. regression.
  2. Describe the tabular form expected by classical machine learning algorithms.
  3. Apply preprocessing steps to prepare tabular data for machine learning.
  4. Apply preprocessing steps to clean textual data.
  5. List techniques for vectorizing textual data.
  6. List techniques for processing and augmenting image data.

### **Week 3: Transformations**

- **Learning Objectives:**
  1. Identify batch transformation use cases and patterns.
  2. Compare in-memory processing frameworks like Spark with disk-based frameworks like Hadoop.
  3. Considerations for choosing distributed vs. non-distributed processing frameworks.
  4. Describe technical considerations for using SparkSQL vs. DataFrames in PySpark.
  5. Explain streaming transformations with engines like Spark Structured Streaming.
