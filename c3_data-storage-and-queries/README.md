# Data Storage and Retrieval 🗄️🔍

This is the repository for **Course 3: Data Storage and Retrieval** from the DeepLearning.AI Data Engineering Professional Certificate. The course explores various storage systems and techniques for efficient data retrieval and query optimization.

## 📖 Overview

We cover the underlying mechanisms of data storage, different storage abstractions like data lakes and warehouses, and delve into query processing and optimization techniques to enhance performance.

## 🗓 Course Structure

### **Week 1: Storage Ingredients and Storage Systems**

- **Learning Objectives:**
  1. Understand how data is physically stored on disk and in memory.
  2. Compare object, block, and file storage systems.
  3. Explain row-oriented vs. column-oriented databases.
  4. Understand how graph and vector databases store and retrieve data.

### **Week 2: Storage Abstractions**

- **Learning Objectives:**
  1. Explain the architectural features of data warehouses and data lakes.
  2. Apply good practices in data lake storage (partitioning, cataloging).
  3. Understand open table formats for transactional data lakes.
  4. Define the data lakehouse storage abstraction.
  5. Implement a data lakehouse with a medallion architecture.

### **Week 3: Queries**

- **Learning Objectives:**
  1. Describe the stages in the life of a query.
  2. Implement advanced SQL queries.
  3. Discuss the role of indexes in query performance.
  4. Summarize approaches for processing aggregate and join queries.
  5. Compare execution times between row and columnar storage.
  6. List strategies for enhancing query performance.
  7. Explain aggregate and join queries on streaming data.
